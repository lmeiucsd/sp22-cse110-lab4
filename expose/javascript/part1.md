# Expose Part 1

### Question 1
values added: 20

### Question 2
final result: 20

### Question 3
values added: 20

### Question 4
error, because result has let declaration, it means that it is not defined outside of the if statement, so line 13, which is out of the if statement, throws an error because result is not defined.

### Question 5
error, since at line 6 we are reassigning a value to a const variable, which is not allowed.

### Question 6
error, same reason as question 5.
